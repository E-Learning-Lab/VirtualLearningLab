# VirtualLearningLab
This website is for a Non-profit in South Africa called Bridge2Africa.
The website is a learning platform aiming to bring STEM content to students all over the world. 
The website contains different courses where students can learn from and an admin panel to add classes.
It uses the Django admin tools and user authentication technology. It is deployed on Digital Ocean on a Linux server. 
I currently had to take leave on the project to pursue other projects for school. 
Though the content is not complete, you can still view the website using the link. (You can use username: demo, password: demo1  to login to the website)
